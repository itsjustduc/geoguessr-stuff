### [Gorgeous Touge Roads](https://www.geoguessr.com/maps/6305565fde2667656468e9b2)

a collection of beautiful-looking roads that go through hills. has some hairpin turns (which is what might come to mind from the title), but also some less curvy mountain passes. it contains official coverage only. it should work fine on NMPZ, but the recommended way of playing it is NM.

if you have locations for this, an issue is welcome! including a json file ready for map-making.app is even more appreciated. NOTE: i do try to have the locations balanced between regions of the world, otherwise the difficulty and odds would be skewed. you can simply import them to see current distribution. if you want to add new ones, please tag them in a unique way using map-making.app's tag system, that way you can export only those. :3 (however, duplicate removal and import tagging seem to work well together, so it's solveable either way)

feel free to also create an issue if a location is bugged!

### Brazil Phone Codes (W.I.P.)

yet another one of these, mainly creating a new one, cause i didn't like any of the ones i've tried lol. i'm trying to put them in cities, but also making sure that no city or state name is visible on the NM view, so that one can practice without accidentally seeing where it is.
